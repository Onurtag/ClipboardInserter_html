- *Method 2: Popup extension*  
  1. Install one of these extensions: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/popup/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/separate-window/cbgkkbaghihhnaeabfcmmglhnfkfnpon) (or any other popup extension)

**Problems with this setup:**  
- You will be seeing two cursors. A bigger cursor for the game and a regular cursor for the overlay.  
- Your mouse is not confined to the window which means that you can accidently click a window outside the game window.  
You can use TSolidBackground (google it) to block this if you want (don't change the Alt+T keybind)  

**Prerequisite:**  
Start the clipboard inserter page in popup mode using one of these methods:
- *Method 1: Autohotkey script*  
  1. Open ```"Clipboard Inserter Overlay Mode.ahk"``` with your text or code editor.  
  2. Scroll down to the block that starts with ```"customStart1:"```
     - Comment the MsgBox line by adding a ```;``` in front of it
     - Uncomment ONE of the run lines (by removing the ```;``` ) and modify those two paths (browser exe path and clipboard inserter html path) for your setup.  
  3. Now you can right click the tray icon of the ahk script and start the clipboard inserter page in popup mode.  
- *Method 2: Popup extension*  
  1. Install one of these extensions: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/popup/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/separate-window/cbgkkbaghihhnaeabfcmmglhnfkfnpon) (or any other popup extension)  
  2. Open ```index.html``` or the [online page](https://onurtag.github.io/ClipboardInserter_html/) and turn it into a popup.

**4.** On the popup clipboard inserter page:  
  - Set auto scroll to top (‚Üë)  
  - Enable overlay mode hotkey in the settings menu  

**5.** Setup Magpie for overlay mode (instructions are for Magpie v0.8.1):  
  - Copy Magpie to another folder and use the new folder if you want to keep your old settings and use Magpie normally.  
  - Change the magpie zoom ```"Hotkey"``` from F11 to something else (or don't)  
  - Settings > Application tab: Enable ```"Restore fullscreen when source window regains focus"```  
  - Settings > Zoom tab: Disable ```"Adjust cursor speed while zoomed"``` and ```"Confine the cursor in 3D games"```  
  - Settings > Zoom tab: Set ```"Zoom factor of the cursor"``` to ```"1.25x"``` and ```"Interpolation mode"``` to ```"bilinear"```  
  - Settings > Advanced tab: Enable ```"Show debugging options"``` and enable ```"Breakpoint mode"```  

**6.** Open ```"Clipboard Inserter Overlay Mode.ahk"``` with your text or code editor.  
  - Under ```"Window Hooker Options"``` replace ```"GAME TITLE"``` with the window title of your game.  

**8.** Run the ahk script ```"Clipboard Inserter Overlay Mode.ahk"``` or restart it.  
**9.** While the clipboard inserter page is active, press the following keys:  
   - ```Ctrl + Alt + 8``` (enables always on Top)  
   - ```Ctrl + Alt + 9``` (enables transparency)

**11.** Use your Magpie hotkey to zoom your game.  

**12.** Done.  
If you have done everything correctly, you should now have a transparent Clipboard Inserter overlay on top of Magpie.  
You can interact with the overlay and use Alt + Tab to switch to another window and back.  
You can hover each button to read its description.  
Toggle the ```Text Visibility``` button if you want to hide the text until you need it. You can hover the same button to temporarily show the text until a new line is added.
